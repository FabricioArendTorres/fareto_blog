# fareto_blog

Source code to my blog (work in progress ;).

Domain: [https://fareto.dev](https://fareto.dev)

## Setup
I build the page with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which builds static html pages based on a template and some markdown files.
The page is self-hosted using coolify, which allows me to automatically pull changes to the main branch of this repo, and use them to build the page.
The building process is done via a Dockerfile.
